**Title: Chart-to-Table Conversion: A Survey of Techniques, Challenges, and Future Directions**

**Abstract:** (Revised Abstract - reflect actual key findings)
"The increasing volume of information presented in visual formats, such as charts and graphs, necessitates efficient methods for converting this data into tabular structures. This survey examines the emerging field of chart-to-table 
conversion, encompassing techniques from Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs). We analyze existing approaches, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, identify key challenges including 
semantic understanding and handling complex chart types, and propose future research directions focusing on the synergistic use of LLMs and Computer Vision."

**1. Introduction**

"The proliferation of data visualization has led to a growing need for methods that can extract structured information from charts and graphs. While visualizations offer powerful ways to communicate data, their unstructured nature presents 
challenges for automated analysis and integration with databases or reporting systems.  Chart-to-table conversion, the process of transforming a visual chart into a tabular representation, is gaining traction as a crucial bridge between 
visual data and machine-readable formats. This survey explores the current state of chart-to-table conversion, focusing on the techniques, challenges, and future trends. The ability to automatically convert charts to tables unlocks a wide 
range of applications including data aggregation, reporting, and accessibility for visually impaired users."

**2. Background & Motivation**

"Traditional methods of data extraction have often relied on manual transcription or rule-based systems that struggle with the diversity of chart designs and the nuances of data meaning. The recent advancements in Computer Vision and NLP 
offer new opportunities for automating chart-to-table conversion. Specifically, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable abilities in understanding and generating structured text, while Computer Vision techniques are crucial for 
recognizing chart elements and extracting data. However, these technologies face unique challenges when applied to the complexities of visual data and require tailored solutions."

**3. Methodology: Chart Selection and Evaluation Metrics**

"To provide a comprehensive analysis, we selected a representative sample of charts across various types, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots. The selection criteria prioritized charts exhibiting varying levels 
of complexity, including multiple axes, legends, and annotations.  The performance of different chart-to-table conversion techniques was evaluated using Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS). RMS quantifies the degree of overlap between the 
ground truth table and the table generated by the conversion technique.  Specifically, it measures the intersection of data entries between the generated table and a reference table, normalized by the size of the ground truth table.  A 
higher RMS score indicates better accuracy. Other metrics considered include the structural similarity of the generated table and a qualitative assessment of data semantic correctness."

**4. Chart-to-Table Conversion Techniques**

**(4.1. Computer Vision-Based Approaches)**
"Early methods heavily relied on Computer Vision techniques to identify chart elements, such as axes, labels, and data points. These approaches typically involve: (1) *Chart Element Detection:* Using techniques like edge detection, Hough 
transforms, and OCR to identify the key visual components. (2) *Data Extraction:* Using geometric relationships and OCR results to extract numerical data from chart elements. The primary limitations of these methods lie in their 
sensitivity to chart variations and lack of semantic understanding."

**(4.2. NLP and Sequence-to-Sequence Models)**
"Recent advances in NLP and sequence-to-sequence models have demonstrated promising results in chart-to-table conversion. These methods often involve: (1) *Image Captioning:* Generating a textual description of the chart. (2) *Table 
Generation:* Using the textual description as input to a sequence-to-sequence model to generate the tabular data. Challenges remain in accurately translating the visual information into a structured textual format and ensuring data 
semantic correctness."

**(4.3. Large Language Model (LLM) Based Approaches)**
"LLMs have recently emerged as powerful tools for chart-to-table conversion.  These models are often prompted with both the visual chart image (using vision-language models like CLIP) and instructions for table generation. The process can 
be broken down as follows: (1) *Visual Encoding:* Vision-language models like CLIP encode the visual chart image into a feature vector. (2) *Prompt Engineering:* Carefully designed prompts instruct the LLM on the desired table format and 
data extraction criteria. (3) *Table Generation:*  The LLM generates the tabular data based on the encoded visual information and the provided prompt.  Examples of prompts used include: 'Generate a CSV table summarizing the data presented 
in this bar chart.'  The performance of LLM-based approaches is significantly impacted by prompt design and the LLM's pre-training data."

**5. Challenges and Limitations**

"Despite recent progress, chart-to-table conversion faces several challenges:
*   **Chart Complexity:** Handling charts with multiple axes, legends, and annotations remains difficult.
*   **Semantic Understanding:** Correctly interpreting the meaning of data points and relationships requires sophisticated semantic reasoning.
*   **Handling Visual Clutter:** Charts with visual clutter (e.g., overlapping data points, complex backgrounds) pose challenges for data extraction.
*   **Robustness to Variations:** Conversion techniques must be robust to variations in chart design and formatting.
*   **Lack of Ground Truth Data:** The scarcity of large, annotated datasets for chart-to-table conversion hinders training and evaluation."

**6. Future Directions**

"Future research should focus on the following areas:
*   **Synergistic Use of Computer Vision and LLMs:** Combining the strengths of Computer Vision for data extraction and LLMs for semantic understanding.
*   **Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning:** Developing techniques that can adapt to new chart types with limited training data.
*   **Interactive Chart-to-Table Conversion:**  Allowing users to interactively refine the generated table and provide feedback.
*   **Incorporating Domain Knowledge:**  Integrating domain-specific knowledge to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated tables.
*   **Development of Standardized Benchmarks:** Creating standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics to facilitate comparison of different approaches."

**7. Conclusion**

"Chart-to-table conversion is a rapidly evolving field with significant potential to automate data extraction and enhance data accessibility. The integration of Computer Vision and Large Language Models holds the key to overcoming current 
limitations and unlocking new applications.  Continued research focused on semantic understanding, robustness to variations, and interactive conversion will drive the field forward and facilitate broader adoption."
